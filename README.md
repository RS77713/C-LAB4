C++ LAB N4. One-dimensional arrays.

Task:

Create 3 separate independent algorithms that solve individual task by using arrays. Individual task number is being defined as in previous labs.
In Visual Studio environment create one (!) console program in C/C++ based on created algorithms by using dynamic one-dimensional array of real (!) numbers with size n (n is entered by user). Implement two ways of array filling: manual (array elements are entered by user) and automatic (array elements are random numbers generated in user specified range). User should be able to select a way of filling (for this create a menu for the user). Note N1: if it is said that array should be transformed (!) (and not arranged) then after relocation of elements to some other part of the array elements should be placed in the same order as it was previously in relation to each other. For example, if array was   {-5.2,  3,  -1.5,  10,  2} and it is said that array should be transformed so that all positive elements are located in the beginning of array and then all negative elements then it does not (!) mean that array should be arranged in descending order. After transformation array should look like this: {3,  10,  2,  -5.2,  -1.5}. Note N2: it is not allowed to use additional array in task N3. All transformations should be done in the same array.

+ variant 14

Define elements count with value 0.
Calculate sum of elements that are located after minimum element.
Arrange array elements by its absolute values in ascending order.
